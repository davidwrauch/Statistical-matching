Use statistical matching/propensite score to determine if a link click in a tech company funnel actually caused better conversion or was just correlated with better conversion because of the kind of person likely to click the link is more motivated already. 

How this analysis works is that we can find all the people who clicked a link in the funnel connected to all our user data about them, and then we can find other people from the same time period who also went through the funnel who are nearly identical to each link click person but DIDN'T click the link (this uses k-nearest neighbor machine learning to find a near identical match for each person who clicked the link). We then compare the revenue per applicant (RPA) or whicever metric of those 2 similar groups to see if the link actually has a stat sig impact. This can be used in so many instances, especially in pre/post.

tldr: there analysis found no statistically significant impact of having the link click when we use statistical matching to compare groups. If we didn't use this more nuanced approach, we would come to the incorrect conclusion that there IS a stat sig difference by comparing the link clickers to the general population (when those two groups are not alike, which is an assumption in statistical significance testing). So considering that the link causes a high amount of dropoff on the question when the link is clicked, we have decent reason to remove the link.
